<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>
	I received a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science with a minor in 
	Mathematics from <a href="http://www.ttu.edu"> Texas Tech University</a> in 
	May of 2007.
</p>
<p>
	I am currently a Software Engineer at <a href="http://www.texmemsys.com">Texas Memory
	Systems</a>.  I have been with the company since May 2007.  I am primarily responsible
	for our web-based regression testing software as well as low-level device driver code.
</p>
<p>
	Prior to working at TMS, I was employed at 
	<a href="http://www.ctsinet.com">Computer Transition Services Inc.</a>
	in Lubbock, TX for almost 4 years.  I was 
	a Computer Technician with CTSI until around February of 2005.
</p>
<p>
    As of February 2005, I became mainly focused on web development during my time at CTSI.  
	I had the privilege of working with two other web developers during my 3 years of 
	develoment with CTSI.  
</p>
<p>
	I learned a lot about programming in general as well as
	many benefits of agile software development and teamwork.  I really enjoyed my
	time at CTSI and still enjoy web development as one of my hobbies.
</p>

	The majority of my work at CTSI was developed using the following:
	<ul>
		<li>
			classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Server_Pages" title="WikiPedia Link">ASP</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			SQL Server <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/es-es/library/ms131287.aspx" title="MSDN">Stored Procedures</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" title="WikiPedia Link">HTML</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/" title="W3C">CSS</a>

		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="http://www.en.wikipedia.com/wiki/JScript" title="WikiPedia Link">JScript</a>
		</li>		
	</ul>
<p>
	For my personal work on the web I use the above technologies and the "Open Source Help".
