		<p>
			Welcome to my homepage.  I am currently a Software Engineer at 
			<a href="http://www.blueback-reservoir.com/">Blueback Reservoir</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			I was previously a Software Engineer at <a href="http://www.ramsan.com">Texas Memory Systems</a> and
			Web Developer intern at <a href="http://www.ctsinet.com">CTSI</a> in Lubbock, TX. 
			This website is an outlet to showcase my web-related work.
		</p>
		<p>
			  I am very interested in clean, but still artistic and beautiful
			  web design.  I am a firm believer in web standards, CSS, and semantic
			  markup.  I worked hard to design this site around these principles, and
			  I look forward to improving it in the future.

			<a href="/work.php"> work</a>.
